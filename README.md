The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of language modeling, giving rise to a multitude of use cases and applications. With a wide variety of LLMs now available, evaluating them for specific tasks has become a challenging endeavor. Additionally, as experiments grow in complexity, tracking results, data, and fine-tuned models becomes increasingly difficult for data scientists.

To address these challenges, I created FTzard, a comprehensive framework designed to assist data scientists in managing their LLM experiments. FTzard offers an end-to-end continual learning pipeline, integrating orchestration with Dagster, experiment and model tracking with MLflow, and data versioning with DVC. This framework not only streamlines the development lifecycle but also accelerates progress by ensuring organization and reducing hassle. In addition to that, it allows you the flexibility of having a reproducible environment using <b>pixi</b> with an inplace config structure harvested using <b>hydra</b>. 

There's no need to jump between folders and piles of notebooks, simply use FTzard's structure for all your projects and remain organised. To get started, simply modify the code in the provided Jupyter notebooks, and your pipeline will be ready to go.
